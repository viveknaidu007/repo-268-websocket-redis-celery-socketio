    "\n",
    "* **Category**: Communication protocol\n",
    "* **Purpose**: Enables **real-time**, two-way communication between a client (like a browser) and a server.\n",
    "* **Use case**: Live chats, multiplayer games, stock updates, etc.\n",

    "* **Category**: Task queue / Asynchronous task runner\n",
    "* **Purpose**: Allows you to **run background tasks asynchronously**, like sending emails, processing images, etc.\n",
    "* **Use case**: Offloading long or delayed tasks so your main app stays fast.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Category**: In-memory data store / Message broker / Cache\n",
    "* **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Acts as a **message broker** for Celery.\n",
    "  * Can be used to **store session data**, **cache** data, or implement **pub/sub** systems.\n",
    "* **Use case**: Fast data access, queue management, caching.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### üß© How They Work Together:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You might use **WebSocket** for real-time updates.\n",
    "* When the user does something that triggers a heavy process, you send that task to **Celery**.\n",
    "* **Celery** uses **Redis** to queue and manage that task.\n",
    "* When the task finishes, you can use WebSocket to notify the client.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So in summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They belong to **different layers** of a backend system.\n",
    "* They're not the same, but they often **complement each other** in real-time, asynchronous applications.\n",
